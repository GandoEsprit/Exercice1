                In <strong>this world there are many things that we cannot imagine</strong> until we experience them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had the <strong>experience of a trip that others call underground</strong>, but I call it an experience of a painful life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had to <strong>leave my traveling companions dead</strong> in the desert because we were abandoned by human traffickers 
                in the middle of the desert without food or water.
            </p>
            <p>
                I let <strong>brothers die carried away by the water</strong> of the Mediterranean sea because 
                they did not have the chance to be saved
            </p>
